## Getting started

This api has been built for Shopify's 2019 developer challenge. The tech stack used is node.js using the express framework for building apis along with a MySQL database.

**This API is designed to work in a local environment provided that you have [npm](#) installed along with Node v10> and a MySQL database.**

Should time permit, a cloud-serviced MySQL database will be provisioned for the purposes of demoing. If such a database is not provided, you may have to configure MySQL locally or on a cloud-hosted platform (such as AWS).
