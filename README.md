## Getting started

This api has been built for Shopify's 2019 developer challenge. The tech stack used is node.js using the express framework for building apis along with a MySQL database.

**You can interact with this API using NPM. Ensure you've got Node installed using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Simply run `nvm use` in the root of this repository.**

Should time permit, a cloud-serviced MySQL database will be provisioned for the purposes of demoing. If such a database is not provided, you may have to configure MySQL locally or on a cloud-hosted platform (such as AWS).

To begin, fork this repository and initiate the project by running
